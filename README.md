# ufo-data-analysis

This is a data analysis writeup I performed for a company as part of their interview process for their Data Scientist position. I was asked to create a classification model using a UFO data set they provided. The writeup can be found in the ufo_analysis.ipynb file.

I was also asked to create a REST api using Django that could load the trained model and allow prediction requests. That can be found in the ufo_api folder.
